# Student Registration Form

This project is a Python-based application that collects information from students and stores it in a `.txt` file. The application leverages Python's core concepts, the `tkinter` library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI), and basic file I/O for writing data to files.

## Features

- User-friendly interface created using the `tkinter` library.
- Collects student details such as name, age, address, and other relevant information.
- Stores the collected data in a `.txt` file for easy access and record-keeping.
- Demonstrates the use of Python's core concepts and file handling.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the application.
- **tkinter**: Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **I/O Operations**: For writing student data to a `.txt` file.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rangat001/Student-Registration-Form-.git
   cd Student-Registration-Form-

2.Install Python (if not already installed). You can download Python from python.org.

3.Run the application:
python main.py

4.Fill in the student information using the GUI.

5.Click the submit button to save the data. The information will be stored in a .txt file in the project directory.

## Future Enhancements

--Add functionality to retrieve and display student records.
